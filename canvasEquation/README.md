#### Canvas Equations

This project is going to be used to generate graphs for n random points. Initally going to be
used to generate graphs for 6 distinct points. The steps for generating a graph are as shown

* Obtain the n random points (assumption is that points are for x values from 0)
* Generate the equation of the unique line/curve that passes through these n points
* Use that equation to render the graph on the canvas
